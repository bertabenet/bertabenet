Hello! 👋

I am @bertabenet and welcome to my profile ✨! A little bit about myself:
- 👅 I am from Barcelona and my native language is Catalan. However, I also speak Spanish as a native speaker and English at full professional proficiency.
- 👩🏻‍🎓 I graduated on 2021 on Mathematical Engineering in Data Science in Universitat Pompeu Fabra.
- 🧠 I did my practicum at Vall d'Hebron Institut de Recerca (VHIR) where I developed machine learning and deep learning algorithms on image classification of livers.
- 📊 On July 2021 I started as a new partner at the start-up [EXPAI](https://expai.io) (@expai-io) where we developed a simple platform that could make transparent the black-box models that companies use.
- 🤔 I really enjoy programming, modeling and managing databases. I am proficient in Python anf fluent in SQL, Typescript, C/C++ and Java.
- 🫧 My hobbies include crocheting, gaming and crosswords (even though I am not very good at them)!
- 🔥 Now I am looking for a job that can teach me new things and to see how bigger and different teams work!
- 💌 If you want to know anything else about me you can reach me at [berta.benet@gmail.com](mailto:berta.benet@gmail.com).
